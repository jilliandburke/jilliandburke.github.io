          <p class="lead">Currently I am in my second year of the IT program at NSCC in the Web Programming stream. I am learning all the skills I will need to progress into a career in the Web sector of the IT industry, whether it be a corporate, start-up or entrepreneurial career. I am working to master JavaScript, Angular, PHP, Laravel, and more to the best of my ability.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Where Do I Want To Be?</h2>
          <p class="lead">Where I would hope to be after graduation is working as a back-end programmer for a small start-up where the environment is centered around continouous learning, having fun and making a really interesting, innovative, awesome product for the world. Hopefully I'll find this workplace in Halifax as I would like to stay in the area, though I am willing to go wherever I need to in order to get to my dream workplace.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">How Will I Get There?</h2>
          <p class="lead">How I will get to my goal of working for the aforementioned start-up is continuing to work to my highest ability and pass all my classes while learning all the necessary skills needed to work in the IT industry. I would also like to take some online courses in things that aren't available in the school if I have the time so I can have extra skills to bring to the table when applying for potential jobs. I will start by applying to any entry-level job that is of interest to me and fits my skills, but I will also be consistently trying to network so I can hopefully come across many different opportunities to find start-ups I would like to and potentially can work at.</p>
